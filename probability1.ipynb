    "# Probability Basics\n",
    "Probability is the chance that something will occur. In some cases, probability can be calculated but in other cases it may be an educated guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : What are the chances I will flip heads with this coin? There is a 50% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a clear explanation of the **importance of probability** — especially for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and your daily life.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 **Why Probability Is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Foundation of Data Science and Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many ML models **rely on probability** to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: **Naive Bayes Classifier** is built entirely on Bayes’ Theorem.\n",
    "* **Uncertainty handling:** Probability allows machines to **reason under uncertainty** and make decisions with incomplete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Crucial in AI Decision Making**\n",
    "\n",
    "* AI systems often need to **predict outcomes** or **estimate chances** of events.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: In **natural language processing (NLP)**, the next word prediction uses **conditional probabilities**.\n",
    "  * **Recommendation systems** use **probability distributions** to rank content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  3. **Essential for Statistical Thinking**\n",
    "\n",
    "* All of **statistics is built on probability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, p-values,** and **regression models** all use probability theory to measure reliability and significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  4. **Helps Model Real-World Random Events**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whether it’s **weather forecasting**, **sports predictions**, or **stock market analysis**, probability is used to model randomness and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Helps answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * What is the **chance of rain tomorrow**?\n",
    "    * What’s the **risk of a loan default**?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  5. **Decision Making in Uncertainty**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Probability theory helps us make smarter decisions** when outcomes are uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: In **medical diagnosis**, probability helps estimate the likelihood of a disease given symptoms.\n",
    "  * In business, it helps with **risk analysis and strategic planning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  6. **Underpins Advanced Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Bayesian Networks**\n",
    "  * **Markov Chains**\n",
    "  * **Hidden Markov Models**\n",
    "  * **Monte Carlo simulations**\n",
    "  * **Reinforcement learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "####  7. **Improves Logical & Analytical Thinking**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learning probability boosts your ability to **reason logically**, **analyze risks**, and **solve complex problems**.\n",

    "### 🧠 Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical probability is based on **formal reasoning** and assumes that all outcomes in a sample space are **equally likely**. It's derived *before* any experiment is conducted — hence called **a priori**.\n",

    "* $E$ is the event of interest.\n",
    "* The denominator counts all **possible outcomes** in the defined **sample space**.\n",
    "* The numerator counts only the **favorable** outcomes (that satisfy the event).\n",

    "### 🧪 Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The experiment is **well-defined**.\n",
    "2. The outcomes are **finite** and **equally likely**.\n",
    "3. No **bias** exists in the selection process.\n",

    "### 🧠 Real-Life Examples:\n",

    "* Tossing a fair coin → Sample Space: {H, T} → $P(H) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n",
    "* Rolling a fair die → S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} → $P(\\text{even}) = \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5$\n",

    "## 2️⃣ Empirical Probability (Also called *Frequentist* or *Experimental* Probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical probability is derived from **actual observations** or **real experiments**. Instead of assuming outcomes are equally likely, it **relies on data** from repeated trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is called **frequentist** because the probability is interpreted as the **limit of relative frequency** of an event as the number of trials increases.\n",

    "* You toss a coin 1000 times and observe 512 heads →\n",

    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ Subjective Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjective probability expresses a **personal belief** or **judgment** about how likely an event is, **without needing formal data or experiments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called **subjective** because the probability is based on a **person's experience, intuition, or incomplete knowledge**, and may **differ from person to person**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type is used when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The sample space is **unknown or vague**\n",
    "* **No historical data** exists\n",
    "* Decision-makers must rely on **intuition, judgment, or expert opinion**\n",

    "* 1 → Certain\n",
